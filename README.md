# gh-review

A GitHub CLI extension to apply review comments and suggestions directly to your local code.

## Overview

`gh-review` helps you applying the Github code review locally. It fetches review
comments from a pull request, extracts suggested changes, and allows you to
apply them interactively to your local files.

- Fetch review comments from pull requests
- View GitHub suggestions in your terminal
- Apply suggested changes directly to your local files
- Interactively choose which suggestions to apply

## Installation

```bash
gh extension install chmouel/gh-review
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chmouel/gh-review
cd gh-review
go build
gh extension install .
```

## Usage

### List review comments

```bash
# List unresolved review comments (default)
gh review list [PR_NUMBER]

# List all review comments including resolved/done ones
gh review list --all [PR_NUMBER]
```

If no PR number is provided, it will use the PR for the current branch.

### Apply review suggestions

```bash
# Interactive mode - review and apply suggestions one by one
gh review apply [PR_NUMBER]

# Apply all suggestions automatically
gh review apply --all [PR_NUMBER]

# Apply suggestions for a specific file
gh review apply --file path/to/file.go [PR_NUMBER]

# Include resolved/done suggestions
gh review apply --include-resolved [PR_NUMBER]
```

### AI-assisted application

Use AI to intelligently apply suggestions that might have conflicts or outdated context:

```bash
# Interactive mode with AI option available
gh review apply [PR_NUMBER]
# Then select 'a' when prompted to use AI for that suggestion
# You can review the AI-generated patch and optionally edit it in $EDITOR before applying

# Auto-apply all suggestions using AI
gh review apply --ai-auto [PR_NUMBER]

# Use specific AI model
gh review apply --ai-auto --ai-model gemini-1.5-flash [PR_NUMBER]

# Provide API key via flag instead of environment variable
gh review apply --ai-auto --ai-token YOUR_API_KEY [PR_NUMBER]
```

**Prerequisites:** Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable, or use `--ai-token` flag.

See [docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md](docs/AI_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed AI feature documentation.
